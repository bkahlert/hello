# Hello!

## Cheat sheet

### Re-build everything

Gradle's `base` plugin is applied to every included build
and the umbrella project.
Therefor the tasks `assemble`, `build`, `clean`, and `check`
work as expectâ€”also in the umbrella project.

```shell
./gradlew clean build
```

### Update Gradle wrapper

As this is a composite build all Gradle wrappers should be updated.

Otherwise tasks started from inside an included build might find plugins
previously built by another Gradle wrapper with a different version.
This can lead to problems if the two Gradle version make use of a different
Kotlin DSL.

```shell
./gradle-deep wrapper --gradle-version 8.0-rc-1 
```

> ðŸ’¡`gradle-deep` can be found at the root of this repo. It invokes `gradle`
> with the same passed arguments in each root project directory.
